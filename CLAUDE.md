# SquidXplorer

Post-acquisition HCS plate viewer. Reads finished Squid well-plate data (T, C, Z, FOV already on
disk); no live capture, no stage motion.

## Two producers of a region's pixels, and they are not interchangeable

`stitch_plate()` is the mosaic **of record**: registration, fusion, native resolution, ~0.9 GB per
27-FOV well. `_mosaic_source` / `_gallery` produce **preview placement**: FOVs pasted at their stage
coordinates, later-overwrites-earlier, decimated on read. Both go through the SAME `_placement`
helpers, so they are one geometry at two resolutions — never two implementations. Anything that is a
LOOK (pane 2's mosaic, the plate cells, Gallery View) takes the preview path; anything that is a
RESULT takes `stitch_plate`. Adding a third placement rule is the defect shape this repo has the
most of, because the error renders as a plausible image.

A **FOV subset of a region** is expressed one way everywhere: the mapping `{region: [fov, ...]}`,
which is `stitch_plate(regions=…)`'s own parameter and `GalleryScope.fovs`. It is produced by
`PlateWindow.selected_region_fovs()` from the plate selection (marquee, shift-click, Cmd/Ctrl-A).
Do not build a second selection mechanism; `_placement.fov_offsets_px` normalises whatever FOV set
it is handed, so the crop needs no cropping code.

## Nothing decodes on the Qt thread

Measured: `_contrast.py:157` costs 493 ms per region when a caller materialises a dask level on the
UI thread to pick contrast limits. Long reads live in a `QThread` in `_workers.py` (or
`_gallery_window.GalleryWorker`), results arrive per unit so the first one paints while the rest are
still being read, and `tests/test_gallery.py` pins the rule by recording which thread every
`reader.read` ran on. Caches are shared, not per-feature: `_mosaic_source.plane_cache()`,
`_platecache.PlateCellCache`, both bounded by `_budget.cache_budget()`.

## Agent skills

### Issue tracker

Markdown docs in the separate `Cephla-Lab/AI-docs` repo under `SquidXplorer/`, with `to-do` /
`in-progress` / `done` as the status semaphore. Not GitHub Issues, not Linear; `IMA-###` ids are
legacy. See `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`.

### Triage labels

The five canonical roles, unchanged, recorded as a `Status:` line in each ticket file. See
`docs/agents/triage-labels.md`.

### Domain docs

Single-context: `CONTEXT.md` at the root, ADRs in `docs/adr/`. Neither exists yet;
`/domain-modeling` creates them lazily. `docs/rendering-contract.md` and `docs/plate-contract.md`
already act as undeclared ADRs — read them before touching the render or read paths. See
`docs/agents/domain.md`.

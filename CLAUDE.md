# SquidXplorer

Post-acquisition HCS plate viewer. Reads finished Squid well-plate data (T, C, Z, FOV already on
disk); no live capture, no stage motion.

## Agent skills

### Issue tracker

Markdown docs in the separate `Cephla-Lab/AI-docs` repo under `SquidXplorer/`, with `to-do` /
`in-progress` / `done` as the status semaphore. Not GitHub Issues, not Linear; `IMA-###` ids are
legacy. See `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`.

### Triage labels

The five canonical roles, unchanged, recorded as a `Status:` line in each ticket file. See
`docs/agents/triage-labels.md`.

### Domain docs

Single-context: `CONTEXT.md` at the root, ADRs in `docs/adr/`. Neither exists yet;
`/domain-modeling` creates them lazily. `docs/rendering-contract.md` and `docs/plate-contract.md`
already act as undeclared ADRs — read them before touching the render or read paths. See
`docs/agents/domain.md`.
